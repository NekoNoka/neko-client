# Neko Client
This is a program for users of ourworldofpixels where I can add features to ourworldofpixels much easier than originally using Neko Script.

This is possible because this is not a script it is a provided client which connects directly to ourworldofpixel servers.

More information is provided at my [discord server](https://discord.gg/ChGDaWuHgH) where I will also host downloads to the program.

# Download & User Instructions
First you will need to [download the zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NekoNoka/neko-client/refs/heads/main/dist/neko%20client%201.0.0.zip) in the /dist then unzip it.

* For older versions whenever those start existing will be provided using google services, this repository will only host the latest version for download.

For most systems you can just double click the html file inside the folder.

```
./src/index.html
```

Otherwise open the file in your browser of choice.

# For Developers
If you want to clone the repo and run the program (after installing packages) you will need to build first then open the html file in src, this generates the bundle.js file which is used by the html file.
